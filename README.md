# Galactic-Empire-Invaders

## Overview
**Galactic-Empire-Invaders** is a Star Wars-themed Space Invaders parody game developed using Pygame. As a lone Jedi, players navigate an X-wing fighter to battle against the forces of the Empire, culminating in a showdown with the Death Star.

## Gameplay
- **Navigate**: Use the Left & Right arrow keys to move your X-wing left or right.
- **Fire**: Press the Space-bar to shoot at incoming enemies.
- **Health**: Players can sustain two hits before their score is affected (grace period).
- **Enemy HP**: Each enemy has a set health value, typically 5 HP.
- **Restart**: After a game over, restart the program to play again.
- **Power-ups**: Collect health power-ups to extend your survival.
- **Score**: Avoid enemy lasers! Getting hit reduces your score by 1. A score below 0 results in a loss.
- **Boss Fight**: Defeat the Death Star to claim victory.
